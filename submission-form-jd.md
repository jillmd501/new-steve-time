Everything works except that I was not able to close the poll.

### What features did you complete which you feel 'exceeded expectations'?


# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[test](https://github.com/jillmd501/new-steve-time/blob/master/test/count-test.js#L4-L15)
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Since API-Curious, I have realllllly struggled with using Test Driven Development. I have had the mind set of just getting it to work, and then worrying about getting enough tests that looked like I deserved at least a three. I used this test to build out so much functionality and while it is only one, it covers a lot of ground.  Honestly, I am mostly happy that I learned how all the pieces of this crazy express app work together. ðŸ’ª

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[client.js](https://github.com/jillmd501/new-steve-time/blob/master/public/client.js#L11-L19)
#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

it('will not tally multiple votes', function(){
  var expectedResult = {'jill': 2, 'joe': 1}
  expect(countVotes(poll)).to.deep.equal(expectedResult)
});
